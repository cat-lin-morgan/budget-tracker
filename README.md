# Budget Tracker

## Description

This was an introduction for myself into the world of PWAs. Fully built budget tracker with service workers and a manifest.json file. Application works with the mongo atlas db!

Application can be installed to your machine! There's a :x: in the upper right hand corner of the address bar. Click it to install this application.<br/>
 _You must use Google Chrome for this feature, as not all browsers have PWA support._

## Deployed Application
