# Budget Tracker

## Description

This was an introduction for myself into the world of PWAs. Fully built budget tracker with service workers and a manifest.json file. Application works with the mongo atlas db!

Application can be installed to your machine! There's a :heavy_plus_sign: in the upper right hand corner of the address bar.<br/>
Click it to install this application.<br/>
 _If you do not see this feature, try Google Chrome, as not all browsers have PWA support._
